        <p> <b>Let’s cut to the chase:</b> I will no longer be an exchanger or middleman. I’ve decided to step down from all related services as of this announcement, and I’ll be stepping away from the Roblox Selling Community. </p> 
        <p> As valuable as my time in these roles has been, it became clear that I need to expand my horizons and move on. In light of this new direction, I am ending my involvement with exchanging and middlemanning and focusing on more ambitious projects. I’m already working on several exciting endeavors, which I hope to share soon. </p> 
        <p> I want to thank everyone who supported and trusted me over the years. It’s been a pleasure to serve you. I’m excited about the path ahead and hope you’ll continue to follow my journey. </p>

        <p>
          Sincerely,<br>
          <strong>Siege.</strong>
