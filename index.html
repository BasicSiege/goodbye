        <p> <b>Let's be realistic:</b> We can't stay in "Comm" forever. I will be resigning from all positions within the community including being an exchanger and middleman. I’ve decided to step down from all related services as of this announcement, and I’ll be stepping away from the Roblox Selling Community. </p> 
        <p> It has become clear that I need to move on. I am ending my involvement with exchanging and middlemanning and focusing on things outside of this aspect. As of Sodium the project will continue and allow for users to sell, trade, and buy, which I hope to share soon. </p> 
        <p> I want to thank everyone who supported and trusted me over the years. It’s been a pleasure to help. As you read this please consider following these same steps as you get older. </p>

        <p>
          Sincerely,<br>
          <strong>-Siege.</strong>
